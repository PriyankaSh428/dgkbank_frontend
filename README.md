# DGKBank Frontend

Steal this code.

# Endpoints
All the endpoints, and the base URL, are consts listed at the top of stuff.js. Change this as necessary.

# Requests
The final requests made to each endpoint (And the functions that stuff.js will call) are specified in endpoints.js. You may modify these as necessary.
Near the top of stuff.js itself there are also a couple of constructors for the data payloads that will head to these requests. You will almost certainly need to modify these functions.
